****\
Today we have a whole group of young people called millennials, who appear to be disoriented, wandering and directionless. Nonetheless, this young group are the most educated, liberal, social, cooperative and creative generation in history. When they just seem to sit and have coffee with people, some of them are sharing ideas, experiences and concepts on issues that we go through every day.

“A good Idea becomes a great idea when you let it out”

Our Initiative is to provide a public platform for these millennials so that they can share among them, their ideas, experiences and unique perspectives, that would inspire and enlighten the young group in our community. We strive to create a community that hears the voice of these young generations, to bring out their true potential.

The main purpose of the event is to empower the youth and their creative unique ideas. Inspired by the Tedtalks, the mission of this event series is to provide a platform where anyone, especially the youth, can express their ideas and concerns to a wider audience to provide inspiration and bring positive and constructive change to the society. Thus, our vision lies in creating a community which values the opinions of the younger generations and to build and environment which can lead them to the best of their potential.
